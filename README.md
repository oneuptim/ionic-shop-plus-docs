# External Dependencies
The following external accounts are needed to work with this package as it is:

- An account for the database (firebase.com)
- An account to receive payments (stripe.com)
- An account on Mashape to consume the Stripe Payments API (mashape.com)

# Getting started

Unzip the package in your workspace. You will find two folders:

- ionic-app
- admin

# Setup 1: Payments

We first need to define a couple of constants in our app. If you are working with Angular/Ionic `v1.x`, head over to  `ionic-app/www/js/app.js` and you'll see the following at the top:

```
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// !important settings
// Please fill in the following constants to get the project up and running
// You might need to create an account for some of the constants.

// Obtain your unique Mashape ID from here:
// https://market.mashape.com/noodlio/noodlio-pay-smooth-payments-with-stripe
var NOODLIO_PAY_API_URL         = "https://noodlio-pay.p.mashape.com";
var NOODLIO_PAY_API_KEY         = "<YOUR-UNIQUE-MASHAPE-ID>";

// Obtain your unique Stripe Account Id from here:
// https://www.noodl.io/pay/connect
// Please also connect your account on this address
// https://www.noodl.io/pay/connect/test
var STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID           = "<YOUR-UNIQUE-STRIPE-ID>";

// Define whether you are in development mode (TEST_MODE: true) or production mode (TEST_MODE: false)
var TEST_MODE = true;
```

The `NOODLIO_PAY_API_URL` is basically the location of the server and is fixed (Do not change this!). The variable `TEST_MODE` simply takes the values `true` or `false` and defines whether we are in test mode (development) or production (actually charging the user). Now let's define two constants:

**Mashape**

To consume the Stripe Payments API, we'll need to obtain our unique `NOODLIO_PAY_API_KEY`. To do so, head over to [Mashape](https://market.mashape.com/noodlio/noodlio-pay-smooth-payments-with-stripe) and click on the right "Get your API Keys and Start Hacking" or press on "Sign up free".

[<img src="http://noodlio-templates.firebaseapp.com/noodlio-pay/img/mashape-api-keys.png">](https://market.mashape.com/noodlio/noodlio-pay-smooth-payments-with-stripe)

After you are signed in, you'll find your unique API Key in the request example on the [Stripe Payments API page](https://market.mashape.com/noodlio/noodlio-pay-smooth-payments-with-stripe):

```
curl -X POST --include 'https://noodlio-pay.p.mashape.com/charge/token' \
  -H 'X-Mashape-Key: <YOUR-MASHAPE-API-KEY>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  ... other values
```

Replace the `NOODLIO_PAY_API_KEY` with this unique identifier.

**Stripe Account**

If you haven't already [sign up for a Stripe Account](https://www.stripe.com). After that, you'll need to retrieve your unique Stripe Account ID (field: `stripe_account`), which you can obtain on the following pages (Note: **you'll need to visit both links once**):

- For the production mode:
[https://www.noodl.io/pay/connect](https://www.noodl.io/pay/connect)
- For the development mode:
[https://www.noodl.io/pay/connect/test](https://www.noodl.io/pay/connect/test)

The Stripe Account ID looks something like `acct_12abcDEF34GhIJ5K`. Replace the constant `STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID` wherever you have defined it.

That's it. Our payment server is configured and ready to receive payments.

# Setup 2: Firebase
We use Firebase as a database to host your shopping items, i.e. the products that you are selling. These items are managed through an admin panel that is provided with this package in the folder `admin`.

## Add firebase to your app

1. Head over to Firebase.com (sign/log in to the console panel) and **Create a new project**.
2. Open the project, and in the section *Overview* press on **Add firebase to your web app**. Copy this html/script code.
3. In both the `admin` and `ionic-app` folder, open `index.html` and replace the section "Firebase v3" (`line 28`) with the code you just copied.

## Copy/paste the Security Rules
To secure your app we will need to add Firebase security rules:

1. Open the file `firebase_rules.txt` and copy the content
2. Go to your Firebase project, on the left click on **Database** and then select **Rules**.
3. Paste (overwrite) all content with the content of `firebase_rules.txt`

## Enable password authentication

1. To allow users to login, head over to **Authentication** in your project workspace and press on **Sign in method**.
2. Enable E-mail and Password (minimum requirement!).
3. The instructions for enabling social authentication will follow soon.


# Setup 3: Admin panel

The admin panel allows you to manage the products you sell in the Ionic App. It also provides you with additional settings (such as fees, categories, etc.)

To enter the admin panel, you'll need a workspace that supports Angular v1.x. A good option is to use a Cloud IDE such as Cloud9:

1. Head over to `www.c9.io`
2. Create an account or sign in
3. In your dashboard, create a new workspace (select nodejs)
4. Open this workspace
5. Delete all the files in there (except for the folder .c9)
6. Upload (drag and drop) all the files from this package to the workspace (drop the files at the folder <your-workspace-name>)
7. Open `index.html` and then press Run (green button in top)

Your admin panel should be served now on something like ``[name-workspace]-[username].c9users.io`
Note: if you are not active for two days, you will need to login to your workspace and press again the green button Run to activate the admin. This can be overcome by uploading all your files to a custom server or by managing it locally (`localhost` with `nodejs`).

## Extending the Authorized Domains for oAuth redirect

If you are hosting the Admin panel on a foreign location (in the cloud), you will need to extend the authorized domains for oAuth redirects in Firebase. To do so:

1. In your Firebase project, head to **Authentication** and press on tab **Sign in methods**.
2. Scroll down to the section **OAuth redirect domains**
3. Add the top field location of your admin panel. If you are hosting it on cloud9 then you would typically add: `https://[admin-workspace-name]-[your-username].c9users.io`

## Firebase Admin Rights

The instructions for this part are visually explained in the folder `admin/img/examples`. Rune the admin at its root folder (`index.html`) and follow steps 1-4 to define the administrator. The administrator manages the items that are displayed in the Ionic Shop.

# Setup 4: Ionic V1 App

Now that we have prepared the back-end, it's time to setup and run the front-end. If you are familiar with Ionic Framework, then you know the structure of such apps. If you are new to Ionic, then you probably need to setup the dependencies. Here is [how to get started with Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/overview/#download):

```
$ npm install -g cordova ionic
```

Usually you would follow up by typing something like `ionic start myApp tabs`. This is not needed anymore since all the files are in the folder `ionic-app`. To run the application, the only thing you need to do is:

```
$ cd ionic-app
$ ionic-serve
```

If you are working locally, you can then visit `http://localhost:8100/` in your browser to
preview your application.

You can also unpack all the files in a cloud environment such as Cloud9 (see instructions above, they are similar).

**IMPORTANT**: when going through the Ionic Docs, make sure you are always in the V1 section!

# Wrapping up
So far you have setup all the constants and variables. If everything went well, all should be working fine now. To proceed, you can now login to your admin panel and add items. These items will be immediately (after refreshing) shown in your Ionic App. You can try to make a test purchase in the Ionic App. You will see the payment immediately reflected on your Stripe Account. The orders will be also visible in both the admin management as the orders section of the app. Have fun earning money!

# Questions?

If you have questions or remarks, please let me know by either typing a comment on this site, or by e-mailing me to: `noodlio@seipel-ibisevic.com`

Have fun!
